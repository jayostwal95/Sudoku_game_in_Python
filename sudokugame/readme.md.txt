This project creates a GUI interface for solving the sudoku game which can be played by the user. It is developed majorly by using the core concepts of python and
with the help of the backtracking algorithm. The backtracking algorithm is simply reverting back to the previous solution as early as we find out that our current solution 
cannot be continued to a complete one.

Language/technologies used : Python3

Instruction to run the code :

1. Download and install Jupyternotebook.

2.After installing jupyternotebook,you will see the list of all the files loaded in your computer.

3. Locate the folder where the code has been downloaded. Make sure all the code is in the same directory.

4. Load the file into jupyternotebook making sure its in html or ipynb/py format.

5.After loading the code into the jupyter notebook,under kernel tab above, there will be an option 'restart and run all'.

6.Click that option and the code will be running with outputs on each cell.

7.Close the jupyternotebook.


Software Used: jupyternotebook.

Finally, we can see a GUI being developed which allow us to play the sudoku game.
